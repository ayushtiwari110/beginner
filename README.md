hello all
I have created this simple tic toe project , given by jet brains academy website in just 45 lines, and that too without use of any functions!!!!
you can find the project in this repository itself.
I am a beginner so created this by topics which i know well, mainly basics like arithmetic operators, loops, lists.
I would be extremely happy for any feedbacks or improvements which i could do in this
# NOTE: I have created this on basis of instructions given on their website. I am writing below this their instructions, so you can get a better idea of what was to be created and whether i have performed well or not.

Description
In this stage, we’re going to analyze the game state to determine if either player has already won the game or it is still ongoing, if the game is a draw, or if the user has entered an impossible game state (two winners, or with one player having made too many moves).

Objectives
In this stage, your program should:

Take a string entered by the user and print the game grid as in the previous stage.
Analyze the game state and print the result. Possible states:
# Game not finished when neither side has three in a row but the grid still has empty cells.
# Draw when no side has a three in a row and the grid has no empty cells.
# X wins when the grid has three X’s in a row.
# O wins when the grid has three O’s in a row.
# Impossible when the grid has three X’s in a row as well as three O’s in a row, or there are a lot more X's than O's or vice versa (the difference should be 1 or 0; if the difference is 2 or more, then the game state is impossible).
# In this stage, we will assume that either X or O can start the game.

# You can choose whether to use a space or underscore _ to print empty cells.
